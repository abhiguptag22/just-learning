## Welcome to my First Page

I can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/abhiguptag22/just-learning/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/abhiguptag22/just-learning/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
